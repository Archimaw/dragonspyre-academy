# Dragonspyre Academy
> The first modernized wizard101 discord and trading server and hangout!

## Alert!
There's going to be a minor delay on everything due to some life decisions and problems!
I won't be able to be on as often, because I'm taking care of a sick family member!
I hope everyone understands!

### What's this server about?
We're wanting to bring everyone into one server and have a big economy for everyone to use in game!
This means everything will be handled automatically with bots, APIs, many other various projects.

I don't want this to seem too "nerdy", but wizard101 isn't exactly a modernized game!
This server helps either maintain liberties and help others understand the game better, either you're new or a veteran player.
It's meant to be helpful toward everyone, know that aside; we do have some features that do make it better for everyone.

### Planned Features
- Automated Auctions, Trading & much more!
- User profiling & stores and currency management?
- Forums, Wikipedias, calculators and everything you need for the best experience!
- Users can hold events of their own and giveaways specific by requirements and validation sequences by a bot!
- Generally making everything simplified for everyone following KISS Principles and Minimalism
- Users can also commiciate with using temporary channels and containers! (Where the user, who created the channel; becomes the host; 
  Once you leave the channel, it'll delete itself!
)

### How can I contribute?
I'm glad, you asked yourself this question, you can invite members and receive various rewards based (on the reward bot and boosting)
helping us out, we'll give you more features and perks! (it's called fair trade literally! 😜)

### Boosting & Rewards
There are various levels with the profiler, I haven't gone into detail about such as (badges, levels, forum levels, user reputation, bans, etc.)
This information is just a basis for the server and keeps everyone informative about one another; there are some privacy settings with our bot,
you can take advantage of and advancements of.

### Partnerships
This hasn't been planned is in a state of being (developed)

### User Rating and/or Reputation
This is from your trading experiences and comments on your profile, someone can literally direct message the bot or use our server!
If you scam or do something negative eventually the bot or professors will catch up on this and (Unfortunate things will happen)
