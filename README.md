# Dragonspyre Academy
> The first modernized wizard101 discord and trading server and hangout!


# What's this server about?
We're wanting to bring everyone into one server and have a big economy for everyone to use in game!
This means everything will be handled automatically with bots, APIs, many other various projects.

I don't want this to seem too "nerdy", but wizard101 isn't exactly a modernized game!
This server helps either maintain liberties and help others understand the game better, either you're new or a veteran player.
It's meant to be helpful toward everyone, know that aside; we do have some features that do make it better for everyone.

# Planned Features
- Automated Auctions, Trading & much more!
- User profiling & stores and currency management?
- Forums, Wikipedias, calculators and everything you need for the best experience!
- Users can hold events of their own and giveaways specific by requirements and validation sequences by a bot!

(everything is subject to change due to time)
Remember all these features are considered `experimental and being played with`
